# Azeroth Nodes

Welcome to Azeroth Nodes, a distributed file system forged in the heart of Azeroth, powered by the Python language. Just as the Alliance and Horde work together (or sometimes at odds) to secure the safety and prosperity
of Azeroth, Azeroth Nodes aims to provide a resilient, scalable, and secure environment for storing and retrieving the
realm's most precious artifacts‚Äîyour data.

## üìù Documentation

If you want to get a little bit more of information about the documentation you can check the
[`documentation/`](https://github.com/Youngermaster/Azeroth-Nodes/tree/main/documentation) folder. We currently have:

- [Theoretical Framework](https://github.com/Youngermaster/Azeroth-Nodes/tree/main/documentation/TheoreticalFramework): This
  folder contains the theoretical framework of the project, where we based on the GFS and HDFS papers to create the base of the project. Just click or download the [main.pdf](https://github.com/Youngermaster/Azeroth-Nodes/blob/main/documentation/TheoreticalFramework/main.pdf) file.

## Overview

Azeroth Nodes is inspired by the vast, interconnected world of World of Warcraft, where heroes band together to face
challenges far greater than any could tackle alone. This project seeks to emulate that spirit of cooperation and
interconnectedness by creating a file system that is decentralized, fault-tolerant, and capable of scaling to meet the
needs of the modern data-driven world.
